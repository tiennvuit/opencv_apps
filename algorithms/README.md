# Guide for adding functions/operations to app.

To insert one operation/algorithm into app, do the following steps:

-  **Define** a function for the operation with the relevance parameters in the class Algorithm.
- In the function process of file process.py, **insert the call function** to get the output from the function just defined.
- Go to the main() function in file process.py, **add the arguments** to run app via **command line** on Terminal/Cmd.
